# Rust TODO List
This is a simple TODO list application written in Rust, designed to be run in the command line interface (CLI). It allows users to add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and list all tasks in the current list.

## Requirements
In order to run this application, you will need to have Rust installed on your computer. You can download Rust here.

## How to Use
To use the TODO list application, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt. Then, run the following command:
</br> <code>cargo run</code> </br>

This will compile and run the Rust program, and you will see the following prompt:
</br> <code>></code> </br>

You can interact with the program by typing commands and pressing "Enter". Here are the available commands:

<ul>
  <li><code>list</code> - Lists all tasks in the current list</li>
  <li><code>done</code> - Prompts the user to enter an item number to mark as done</li>
  <li>Any other text input - Adds a new task to the list with the input as its description</li>
</ul>

To exit the program, simply type quit and press "Enter".
